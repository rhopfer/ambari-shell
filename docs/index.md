# Ambari Shell

[Ambari](http://ambari.apache.org/) is aimed to help provision/manage/monitor Hadoop clusters.
Although it has a [REST API](https://github.com/apache/ambari/blob/trunk/ambari-server/docs/api/v1/index.md),
right now the only way to use Ambari is by using the web-application.

Ambari Shell's aim is to provide an interactive command line tool which supports:

- all functionality available through Ambari web-app
- context aware command availability
- tab completion
- required/optional parameter support

## Architecture

To implement Ambari Shell the following options were evaluated:

- **python**: seems a natural fit, as a few components of Ambari are written in python. Also
  an [Ambari python shell](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AMBARI/Ambari+python+Shell)
  was announced on Ambari wiki page, but after a discussion with committers, it turned out
  to be abandoned path. The official [Ambari python client](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AMBARI/Ambari+python+Client)
  hasn't been released, so the python option is eliminated.
- **go**: go would solve nicely the usual dependency hell (pip, gem, classpath, you name it), but unfortunately our
  team has no experience with it.
- **java**: The **write-once-run-everywhere** nature provides support for all OS. [Spring Shell](http://docs.spring.io/spring-shell/docs/1.0.x/reference/htmlsingle/#preface)
  seems a natural fit as a base framework.

Spring Shell is also battle tested in various Spring projects including:
- [Spring-Roo](http://projects.spring.io/spring-roo/): lightweight cli tool to aim Rapid Application Development
- [Spring-XD](http://docs.spring.io/spring-xd/docs/1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/reference/html) a user-friendly
  front end for the REST API of Spring XD. Spring XD is a unified, distributed,
  service for data ingestion, real time analytics, batch processing, and data export.
- [Spring-Rest-Shell](https://github.com/spring-projects/rest-shell) a command-line shell that aims to make writing REST-based applications easier.
  Spring Rest-Shell itself would be enough to communicate against Ambari REST API, but we wanted a more
  Domain Specific Language (DSL) nature of the command structure.

## Installation and usage

Ambari Shell is distributed as a single-file executable jar. So no `ClassNotFound` should happen. The  **uber jar**
is generated with the help of spring-boot-maven-plugin available at [Spring-Boot](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.0.1.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#executable-jar).
Spring-Boot also provides a helper to launch those jars: [JarLauncher](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.0.1.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#executable-jar-launching).

After compiling the project, the shell is ready to use (make sure you use Java 7 or above).

```
java -jar ambari-shell/target/ambari-shell-1.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --ambari.server=localhost --ambari.port=8080 --ambari.user=admin --ambari.password=admin
```

The `--ambari` options can be omitted if they are the default values, otherwise you only need to specify the difference, e.g if only the port is different

```
java -jar ambari-shell/target/ambari-shell-1.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --ambari.port=49178
```
```
    _                _                   _  ____   _            _  _
   / \    _ __ ___  | |__    __ _  _ __ (_)/ ___| | |__    ___ | || |
  / _ \  | '_ ` _ \ | '_ \  / _` || '__|| |\___ \ | '_ \  / _ \| || |
 / ___ \ | | | | | || |_) || (_| || |   | | ___) || | | ||  __/| || |
/_/   \_\|_| |_| |_||_.__/  \__,_||_|   |_||____/ |_| |_| \___||_||_|

Welcome to Ambari Shell. For command and param completion press TAB, for assistance type 'hint'.
```

Please note that all commands are context aware - and are available only when it makes sense.
For example the `cluster create` command is not available until a `blueprint` has been added or selected.
A good approach is to use the `hint` command - as the Ambari UI, this will give you hints about the available commands and the flow of creating or configuring a cluster.

*You can always use TAB for completion or available parameters.*

Example:

Once you logged in you can say `hello`.

                    .-.._
              __  /`     '.
           .-'  `/   (   a \
          /      (    \,_   \
         /|       '---` |\ =|
        ` \    /__.-/  /  | |
           |  / / \ \  \   \_\
           |__|_|  |_|__\

Initially there are no blueprints available - you cn add blueprints from file or URL. For your convenience we have added 2 blueprints as defaults.
You can get these blueprints by using the `blueprint defaults` command. The result is the following:
```
  BLUEPRINT              STACK
  ---------------------  -------
  hdp-singlenode-2.2     HDP:2.2
  multi-node-hdfs-yarn   HDP:2.2
  hdp-multinode-default  HDP:2.2
  lambda-architecture    HDP:2.2
  single-node-hdfs-yarn  HDP:2.2
```

Once the blueprints are available you can use them to create a cluster. You can use the following command: `cluster build --blueprint single-node-hdfs-yarn`.
Now that the blueprint is selected you have to assign the hosts to the available host groups.

Use `cluster assign --hostGroup host_group_1 --host server.ambari.com`.

You can always `cluster reset` or `cluster preview` to modify or check the configuration.
```
  HOSTGROUP     HOST
  ------------  -----------------
  host_group_1  server.ambari.com
```

Once you are happy with host assignment, you can choose `cluster create` to start building the cluster. Progress can be checked either in the Ambari UI or using the `tasks` command.
```
  TASK                        STATUS

  HISTORYSERVER INSTALL       QUEUED
  ZOOKEEPER_SERVER START      PENDING
